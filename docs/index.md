# CloudTrader
Open source cloud trading software.

## Mission
Turning you into a superhuman trader.

## Background
I have been using my own private code to analyze financial market data and send trade alerts to myself.  I have given myself superhuman trading abilities and plan to share parts of my code over time as open source.

## Why Share?
By sharing the "kitchen" blueprint, but not the "secret sauce" recipe, I'm hoping that others can help make the kitchen better.  We can work on the cloud trading platform code together, while keeping our trading strategies that run on it secret.

## Source Code
The source code is being released over time on [github.com/cloudtrading/cloudtrader](https://github.com/cloudtrading/cloudtrader).
