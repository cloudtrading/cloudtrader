[Tickers](https://www.tickers.com) is planning to release CloudTrader, a cloud-native open-source project that you can run in your own [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) cloud account. It will retrieve market data from your brokerage accounts, and it's all about privacy - your trading strategies and algorithms stay just with you. It will be reliable, especially when it comes to sending out trade alerts - you won't miss any important info.

Optionally, you will be able to visualize markets like never before on Tickers. The cool part is that if you run the open-source project, you will be able to display your own data and indicators in your visualizations on Tickers. Your browser will fetch this data privately from your AWS cloud account without sending it to Tickers.

I'll be running my own trading system using the open-source project in my personal AWS account. So, I'll be trading the markets and making money using the exact same tools that I'm providing to other traders.

So, in short, CloudTrader will give you a private, reliable way to run your trading system, and Tickers will offer an easy-to-use platform to visualize market data like never before. And it's all free! Be sure to watch this repo for the first release of open-source CloudTrader and [join the Tickers waitlist](https://www.tickers.com) for early access.
